🚨 Note on Documentation & Persistence

To prevent scammers from hiding their tracks by deleting repositories or editing deceptive claims after being exposed, the Wall of Shames follows a strict Persistence Protocol:

-  Immutable Forks: We create an immediate fork of every identified scam repository. These forks serve as a permanent "Snapshot of Deception."

- Log Archiving: All admission of guilt, deceptive marketing comments, and technical failures are archived as screenshots and Markdown logs within our private database.

- The "Wall of Shame" Mark: Even if a repository is deleted by the owner or GitHub, the evidence remains public on our platform to inform the community and law enforcement.

"You can delete your repo, but you cannot delete the record of your actions."
