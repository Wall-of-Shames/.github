### Exposing Fraudulent AI Tools & GitHub Scams

A community-driven project documenting and analyzing fake "AI Hacking Tools" and scams (thanks to AI assistance!) that exploit non-technical and young users through social media.

---

## 📋 About This Project

**Led by:** [Volkan Şah](https://github.com/VolkanSah) & [BadTin](https://github.com/BadTin) for NCF

This organization focuses on **technical verification** of suspicious repositories claiming to be advanced AI tools.

> **Team Note:** Happy birthday to our leader and mentor! A present from him to us on his birthday. WTF, he's getting old! 😄  
> **Leader:** OK, I'll write it in the README! Text, please... Shut up! 😄

### Our Approach

We combine:
- 🔍 **Human expertise** in security and software architecture
- 🤖 **AI-assisted analysis** (Claude for code review, Gemini for data patterns)
- 👥 **Community reports** from developers who spot scams

**We don't just report—we document.** Every claim is backed by code evidence.

---

## 🎯 What We Expose

Common scam patterns include:
- 🎭 API wrappers pretending to be custom AI models
- 💰 Telegram payment funnels disguised as "premium features"
- ⭐ Fake engagement (bought stars, automated forks)
- 🔑 Hardcoded API keys and amateur security mistakes
- 🌐 Fake/scam content worldwide, advertised on Meta platforms, hosted on GitHub with stolen code

> **Our Deal:** We partner with responsible AI providers (Google, Claude, DeepSeek, OpenAI).  
> **The deal is simple:** Stay clean and help heal the internet.  
> **Bottom line:** DON'T SCAM!

## 🔎 Current Focus

**Platforms monitored:** GitHub, GitLab, YouTube, Telegram, Facebook, X (Twitter), Instagram

**Main repository:** [Scammer Accounts](https://github.com/Wall-of-Shames/Scammer-Accounts) *(Not public yet! Follow us for updates - awaiting German law compliance)*

## 🚨 Documentation & Persistence Protocol

To prevent scammers from hiding their tracks by deleting repositories or editing deceptive claims after being exposed, Wall of Shames follows a **strict Persistence Protocol:**

### Evidence Preservation:
- 📸 **Immutable Forks:** We create immediate forks of every identified scam repository as permanent "Snapshots of Deception"
- 📋 **Log Archiving:** All admissions of guilt, deceptive marketing, and technical failures are archived as screenshots and Markdown logs
- 🔒 **Archive Security:** Evidence stored in Wayback Machine + local encrypted backups
- ⚖️ **Legal Documentation:** Chain of custody maintained for potential law enforcement use

### The "Wall of Shame" Mark:
> "You can delete your repo, but you **cannot** delete the record of your actions."

Even if a repository is deleted by the owner or GitHub, the evidence remains accessible on our platform to:
- Inform the community
- Assist law enforcement
- Prevent repeat offenses
- Protect future victims
