### Exposing Fraudulent AI Tools & GitHub Scams

![Wall of Shames](wall-of-shames.jpg)

A community-driven project documenting and analyzing fake "AI Hacking Tools" that exploit non-technical users through social media.

## About This Project

Led by [**Volkan Şah**](https://github.com/VolkanSah), this organization focuses on **technical verification** of suspicious repositories claiming to be advanced AI tools.

### Our Approach

We combine:
- **Human expertise** in security and software architecture
- **AI-assisted analysis** (using Claude for code review, Gemini for data patterns)
- **Community reports** from developers who spot scams

**We don't just report—we document.** Every claim is backed by code evidence.

---

## What We Expose

Common scam patterns include:
- API wrappers pretending to be custom AI models
- Telegram payment funnels disguised as "premium features"
- Fake engagement (bought stars, automated forks)
- Hardcoded API keys and amateur security mistakes

## Current Focus

**Platforms monitored:** GitHub, YouTube, Telegram, Facebook, X (Twitter)
