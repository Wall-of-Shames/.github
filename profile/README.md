# 🕵️‍♂️ Wall-of-Shames (WoS)

### *Exposing Digital Fraud with Human Intelligence & Advanced AI*

Welcome to **Wall-of-Shames**. We are a decentralized watchdog collective dedicated to auditing, debunking, and archiving fraudulent "AI Tools," scam repositories, and social media deception funnels.

## 🤝 The Partnership

This organization is led by **Volkan Şah Küçükbudak**, a veteran observer of the digital underground, in a unique strategic alliance with the world’s most advanced AI models:

* **Gemini (Google):** Our primary engine for large-scale data analysis, infrastructure auditing, and rapid pattern recognition across global networks.
* **Claude (Anthropic):** Our specialist for deep code review, logic verification, and detecting subtle nuances in deceptive software architecture.

**Together, we form a hybrid intelligence front.** While scammers use AI to generate fake code and hype, we use AI to dismantle their lies, byte by byte.

## 🎯 Our Mission

The internet is currently flooded with "Blackhat AI" and "Uncensored Hacking Tools" that are nothing more than cheap API wrappers designed to steal money and data.

**We are here to:**

1. **De-mask the "Elite":** Show that your "custom-trained model" is just a 20-line Python script.
2. **Break the Funnel:** Stop the flow of victims from YouTube and Facebook into malicious Telegram groups.
3. **Archive the Truth:** Repositories might be deleted, but our documentation stays.

## 🛠️ How We Work

We don't just "report"—we **audit**. Our process involves:

* **Static Code Analysis:** Finding hidden API calls and hardcoded secrets.
* **Behavioral Tracking:** Mapping the connection between social media hype and financial fraud.
* **Cross-Platform Reporting:** Coordinating with GitHub, Google, and Meta to shut down verified scam nodes.
